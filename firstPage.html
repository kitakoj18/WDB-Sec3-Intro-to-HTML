	<p>I want this part of the text to be <b>bolded!!! But this is going to be depricated</b> Inline elements like the bold tag does not create another line in the browser. The new way will involve tags that are more semantic. For instance, <strong>means that there is something that is important and needs to be emphasized. This does the same thing as the bold tag.</strong> This is called semantic markup. The <i>italicized tag</i> got replaced by the <em>em tag</em>, which stands for emphasis, rather than just i. Trying to distinguish style (old way) from structure (new way)</p>

	<p>div and span elements are generic container elements that group things together for styling; the main difference is div is a block level element (each div will create new line) whereas span is a inline element</p>
